# Welcome to the Python-Flask stack for June and July 2022!

Here you will find lecture code and notes throughout the 8 weeks of the stack.  Keep an eye on this repository as we progress through the material.  Have a good time learning Python, MySQL and Flask!

A big thank you to Melissa for filling in for me for the Wednesday of Week 3 lecture on June 22, 2022!
